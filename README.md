## LAIP

This project involves a bi-objective LAIP model for a dual-channel, multi-level supply chain network under stochastic demand conditions. The model minimizes the total cost and environmental impact, balancing strategic and tactical decisions in both online and traditional sales channels. The formulation tackles demand uncertainty through stochastic modeling, integrating inventory policy with location and allocation decisions in a complex supply chain.

### Installation Instructions
Ensure that GAMS software is installed on your system to run the model:

  Download and install the latest version of GAMS.
  Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
  Open the GAMS files using GAMS IDE or compatible editors.
  Configure the solver settings as required by the model.

### Usage Instructions
The provided GAMS code implements the optimization model described in the paper. To run the model:

  Open the GAMS file in the GAMS software.
  Review and modify the input data as necessary to suit your specific case study or data set.
  Execute the model in GAMS to obtain solutions for the dual-channel supply chain network under various scenarios.
  Analyze the output to understand the impacts of different parameters on cost and environmental factors.
